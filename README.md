# Touch Locker App

Touch Locker is a simple Android application designed to prevent accidental touches on the screen by locking the device. Unlike the "swimming mode" (screen off mode), the app does not produce any sounds upon unlocking and provides a clean, easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- **Screen Lock**: Prevents accidental touches by locking the screen.
- **No Sound**: The app does not make any sounds when the screen is unlocked, unlike some other screen-locking modes.
- **Simple UI**: A minimalistic and user-friendly interface for controlling the screen lock settings.
- **Customizable Button Selection**: Users can choose either the Home or Back button for unlocking the screen.
- **Easy Setup**: Quickly assign the unlocking button through the settings screen.

## How It Works

- **Locking the Screen**: Once activated, the app locks the screen to prevent accidental touches. The user can choose which button (Home or Back) to use for unlocking the screen.
- **Unlocking the Screen**: To unlock the screen, simply press the selected button (Home or Back).
- **No Sound on Unlock**: Unlike other screen lock modes, this app doesn't produce any sounds when the screen is unlocked.

## Installation

1. Download and install the app on your Android device.
2. Open the app and navigate to the settings to select your preferred unlocking button (Home or Back).
3. Press the button to lock the screen, and to unlock it, press the assigned button.

## App Permissions

- **WAKE_LOCK**: This permission is required to keep the screen on while the app is in use and to manage screen locking.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android SDK
